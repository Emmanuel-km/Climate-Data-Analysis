# CLIMATE DATA ANALYSIS

## About this project
**Climate Data Analysis** project is all about analysing climate data over the past 22 years.

**Timeline** 
The timeline data of this project is from **2000** to **2022**

**Data Source**
The data come from **OUR WORLD IN DATA**
The link to the csv file is https://github.com/owid/co2-data?tab=readme-ov-file

## Project insights
1. Global emmisions over time<br>

Over time CO<sub>2</sub> emmisions have increased though the measures be taking place.<br>
The CO<sub>2</sub> produced builds up from all the possible and thinkable sources, blocks the UV rays from being radiated out of th atosphere causing heating, which leads to global warming.<br>
The end result? Is **Climate change**

2. Top emitters of CO<sub>2</sub><br>
Measures are being taken by respective countries to reduce the emmissions of CO<sub>2</sub>

3. Relation of GDP and the carbon emissions



## Progress
**Day 1**<br>
Launched the project and kickstarted

**Day 2**<br>
Imported data and checked the information in details of the data

**Day 3**<br>
Cleaned the data with df.dropna() and filtered the data to contain data from year: 2000

**Day 4**<br>
Grouped the dataframe by year and the CO<sub>2</sub> 
and plotted a visualisation out of it.<br>
Saved the visualization in visual image folder<br>
<br>

**Day 5**
Added a couple of visualizations <br>

**Day 6**
Finalysing the readme file <br>
